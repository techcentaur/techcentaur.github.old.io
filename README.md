## Personal Blog (hosted with Jekyll)

Going to maintain a blog corresponding to this minimalistic template. 

If you wanna use this template: 
- Easy extension for multiple pages
- Not fully dynamic (works with Jekyll)
- Works only with gems supported by github-pages

For to manage blog posts and drafts, I also wrote a small working web-app; [here](https://github.com/techcentaur/pooblish).
